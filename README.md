The missing `yarn audit fix`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **v11 is not released yet.** The current stable line is **v10.x** (`npm i -D yarn-audit-fix`).
> v11 is published under the npm **`snapshot`** dist-tag, where experimental builds land for early testing:
> ```sh
> yarn add -D yarn-audit-fix@snapshot   # or: npm i -D yarn-audit-fix@snapshot
> ```
> **What v11 brings** — see [Migration notes](#1100) for the full breaking-change list:
> - **New lockfile engine** on [`@antongolub/lockfile`](https://github.com/antongolub/lockfile): patches the lockfile **graph directly**, auto-detecting every yarn schema — Classic + Berry **v4–v10** ([#248](https://github.com/antongolub/yarn-audit-fix/issues/248)).
> - **Faithful lockfile handling** — preserves checksums, integrity, `conditions`/`dependenciesMeta`/`peerDependenciesMeta`, and `patch:` / `resolutions` / git / npm-alias entries, with no spurious churn (real-world locks round-trip unchanged).
> - **Single direct-patch flow** — the legacy `convert` flow and the `--flow` switch (and `synp` conversion) are removed.
> - **Registry-direct audit** — advisories come from the registry's bulk endpoint instead of spawning `yarn`/`npm audit`: works with custom/in-house registries and inherits auth from `.npmrc` / `.yarnrc`. The run is now async (`runSync` removed).
> - **Slimmer footprint** — `jest`→`vitest`; dropped `lodash-es` / `fs-extra` / `chalk` / `js-yaml`; `commander`→`minimist`. Runs on Node **≥ 14.18**, no `engines` pin.

## Digest
### Problem
1. `yarn audit` detects vulnerabilities but cannot fix them. The authors suggest [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/), which is inconvenient in many setups. Discussion: [yarn/issues/7075](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/7075).
2. `yarn audit` does not support custom (in-house) registries — see this [issue](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/7012) & [PR](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/6484), still unmerged.

### Solution
yarn-audit-fix fetches advisories straight from the registry (the npm bulk
advisory endpoint) and patches the lockfile graph directly via [`@antongolub/lockfile`](https://github.com/antongolub/lockfile)
(kudos to [G. Kosev](https://github.com/spion), [code reference](https://github.com/hfour/yarn-audit-fix-ng/blob/main/src/index.ts)).
Full description: [dev.to/yarn-audit-fix-for-yarn-2-berry](https://dev.to/antongolub/the-missing-yarn-audit-fix-for-yarn-2-berry-1p8)

### Key features
* Supports every yarn lockfile schema in the wild: Yarn 1 Classic, Yarn 2/3 (berry v4–v6) and **Yarn 4+** (berry v8/v9/v10), auto-detected via [`@antongolub/lockfile`](https://github.com/antongolub/lockfile).
* Fixes vulnerabilities by patching the lockfile graph directly
* macOS / Linux / Windows
* CLI and JS API
* TypeScript typings

#### Lockfile compatibility

| Yarn  | Lockfile schema           | Supported |
|-------|---------------------------|:---------:|
| 1.x   | `yarn-classic`            | ✅        |
| 2.x   | `yarn-berry-v4`           | ✅        |
| 3.0   | `yarn-berry-v5`           | ✅        |
| 3.1+  | `yarn-berry-v6`           | ✅        |

| 5.x dev | `yarn-berry-v10`        | ✅        |

## Getting started
### Requirements
Node.js: `>=14.18` — inherited from [`@antongolub/lockfile`](https://github.com/antongolub/lockfile)

### Install
```sh
yarn add yarn-audit-fix -D
```
or run it directly:
```sh
npm_config_yes=true npx yarn-audit-fix
```

### CLI
<pre>
$ yarn-audit-fix [--opts]

<b>Verifying package structure...</b>
<b>Patching yarn.lock with audit data...</b>
Upgraded deps (1):
  minimist@1.2.5 → 1.2.6  [critical, CVSS 9.8] GHSA-xvch-5gv4-984h
<b>Done</b>
</pre>

The lockfile is patched **in place** — the fix versions, their new transitive
dependencies, and (for yarn berry) the package checksums are all resolved
straight from the registry, so there's no reconcile `yarn install` step.

| `--ignore`            | Advisory ids to ignore — comma-separated globs matched against the GHSA id (from the advisory url) or the npm advisory id (e.g. `GHSA-*,1106913`). Repeatable.            |                                            |

### ENV
Any CLI option can be set via a `YAF`-prefixed env var. For example:
* `YAF_FORCE` — `--force`
* `YAF_AUDIT_LEVEL=high` — `--audit-level=high`

### JS API
**yarn-audit-fix** exposes its internals, so you can tweak the steps or build your own flow.
Typedoc: [antongolub.github.io/yarn-audit-fix/modules](https://antongolub.github.io/yarn-audit-fix/modules/)

```ts
import { run } from 'yarn-audit-fix'

// async since v11 — advisories are fetched from the registry over HTTP
await run({
   verbose: true
})
```

Individual stages (`resolveBins`, `patchLockfile`, `yarnInstall`, …) are exported too, so you can compose your own pipeline if needed.

## Migration notes
### ^11.0.0
**BREAKING:** the legacy `convert` flow is removed, and so is the `--flow` switch (plus its `synp`-based two-way lockfile conversion and the now-dead `--package-lock-only` / `--legacy-peer-deps` / `--loglevel` / `--only` flags). Direct graph patching is the only flow now — it is more controllable and supports every yarn schema.

With a single flow, the flow abstraction itself is gone: `getFlow`, the `TFlow` / `TStage` types, and the optional custom-flow argument to `run` are removed. Call `run(flags)` — the patch pipeline is inlined. The individual stages are still exported if you want to assemble your own.

Adds first-class Yarn 4+ support ([#248](https://github.com/antongolub/yarn-audit-fix/issues/248)). The bespoke v1/v2 lockfile adapters are replaced with [`@antongolub/lockfile`](https://github.com/antongolub/lockfile), which auto-detects every yarn schema (classic + berry v4–v10). The audit parser handles both the yarn 2/3 `{advisories: …}` shape and yarn 4's NDJSON, deriving `patched_versions` from `Vulnerable Versions` when the field is absent. Each vulnerable package is upgraded graph-natively to the lowest published version that clears its advisory, and the fix version's **new transitive dependencies are pulled into the lockfile** (resolved from the registry) — so an upgrade that changes a package's dependency set no longer leaves the lockfile incomplete.

**BREAKING:** `yarn-audit-fix` no longer runs a reconcile `yarn install`. The lockfile is patched and completed entirely in place — fix versions, their new transitive closure, and (for yarn berry) the recomputed package checksums all come straight from the registry. yaf no longer shells out to yarn, and a `node_modules` directory is no longer required to run it.

**BREAKING:** advisories are now fetched **straight from the registry** (the npm bulk advisory endpoint) instead of spawning `yarn audit` / `npm audit`. This fixes audit against custom/in-house registries ([yarn#7012](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/7012)) and is faster (the lockfile graph is already parsed). The registry, per-scope registries and auth are inherited from `.npmrc` / `.yarnrc.yml` / `.yarnrc` (project then global) + env, or overridden with `--registry`. Auth tokens are bound to the host that declared them and only sent over HTTPS.

**BREAKING:** because the fetch is over HTTP, the run is now async — **`runSync` is removed**. Use `await run(flags)` (the CLI is unchanged). The exported stages are still available if you assemble your own pipeline.

**Node floor / `engines`:** v11 no longer declares `engines.node`, so installing yarn-audit-fix never warns `EBADENGINE` on its own behalf. The effective runtime floor is **Node ≥ 14.18**, inherited from [`@antongolub/lockfile`](https://github.com/antongolub/lockfile). The CLI argument parser also moved off `commander` (which had been ratcheting its own Node floor up) to a tiny `minimist`-based parser — flags, env vars and `--help` are unchanged.

**CLI flags:** both `--exclude` and `--ignore` are applied client-side now (they used to be forwarded to `yarn npm audit`). `--exclude` takes comma-separated **package** rules — `glob[@range]`, e.g. `--exclude="lodash,@scope/*@>=2 <3"` — and skips updating any package whose name matches the glob (and, if a range is given, whose installed version satisfies it); handy for a manually pinned transitive you don't want bumped. `--ignore` keeps its advisory scope but now matches **advisory ids** — comma-separated globs against the GHSA id or the npm advisory id (e.g. `--ignore="GHSA-*"`), dropping matching advisories before the fix. (The npm bulk-advisory endpoint doesn't expose CVE numbers, so — like zx's audit script — matching is by GHSA / npm id.) The standalone `--ignore-engines` flag is removed — there is no longer a reconcile `yarn install` for it to apply to.

### ^10.0.0
v10 bumps the pkg deps and requires NodeJS v14.

### ^9.0.0
v9 adds experimental Yarn 2+ lockfile support and changes how lockfiles are detected (no longer via parse failure).

### ^8.0.0
From v8 the library no longer bundles **npm**, so the system default is used instead. If needed, you can:
* Install the required npm version and provide a custom path via [CLI](#cli) / [ENV](#env) / [JS API](#js-api)
* Use a pinch of **npx** magic: `npm_config_yes=true YAF_NPM_PATH=local npx -p yarn-audit-fix -p npm@8 -c yarn-audit-fix`

### ^7.0.0
Converted to ESM along with its deps, so the legacy `require` API was dropped in v7. Use `import` instead, or try [esm-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qiwi/esm). The CLI works as before.
```js
// const {run} = require('yarn-audit-fix') turns into
import {run} from 'yarn-audit-fix'
```

### ^6.0.0
Default fix strategy [has been changed](https://github.com/antongolub/yarn-audit-fix/releases/tag/v6.0.0) to direct lockfile patching with `yarn audit --json` data. The previous _legacy_ `convert` flow was opt-in via `--flow=convert` until v11, where it was removed entirely.

### ^4.0.0
The `--npm-v7` flag is redundant. From v4.0.0 the package's own **npm** is used by default. You can still pick the system default with `--npm-path=system`, or a custom one with `--npm-path=/another/npm/bin`.

## Troubleshooting
### yarn-audit-fix version x.x.x is out of date
```
npm_config_yes=true npx yarn-audit-fix --audit-level=moderate
Runtime digest
yarn-audit-fix version 4.3.6 is out of date. Install the latest 6.0.0 for better results
```
**npx** caches previously loaded packages, so you need one of:
1. Pin the version: `npx yarn-audit-fix@6.0.0`
2. Reset the npx cache. On macOS/Linux: `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx`

### yarn-audit-fix command not found
After installation, the binary may not be found — usually a `$PATH` issue locating `node_modules/.bin` ([npm/issues/957](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/957)). Two easy ways around it:
* Run it through **yarn**: `yarn yarn-audit-fix`
* Invoke the script directly: `node_modules/.bin/yarn-audit-fix`

### No fix available for some advisories
Some advisories can't be auto-fixed — there's no published version that satisfies the consumer's declared range, so the bump is skipped (re-run with `--force` to apply cross-major updates anyway).
```shell
npm_config_yes=true npx yarn-audit-fix --audit-level=moderate
```
```shell
Patching yarn.lock with audit data...
Upgraded deps: <none>
No fix available: postcss@7.0.27, ws@7.2.3
Done
```
Not everything can be repaired.

### Cannot install package despite being on correct node version
yarn-audit-fix is compatible with any NodeJS version which supports ESM, but nested packages can declare their own engine requirements.
```shell
node-releases@2.0.48: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=18". Got "16.20.1"
```

yarn-audit-fix no longer runs a `yarn install`, so a vulnerable project's own transitive engine constraints can't abort the fix. If you hit this while **installing yarn-audit-fix itself** (or on a later `yarn install` of your own), update the runtime — or pass the flag:
```shell
yarn add yarn-audit-fix -D --ignore-engines
```

### Audit used to fail with a 4xx on an odd transitive

Earlier versions spawned **yarn npm audit** / **npm audit**, which could choke on an unusual `yarn.lock` entry (e.g. a transitive in `npm:` alias form) and return `400 Bad Request` ([berry#4117](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/4117)).

v11 no longer spawns an audit subprocess — advisories are fetched straight from the registry's bulk endpoint for the parsed lockfile graph — so this failure mode is gone. If you still want to leave a specific package alone, exclude it client-side (no yarn version requirement):
```shell
npx yarn-audit-fix --exclude example-dependency
```
