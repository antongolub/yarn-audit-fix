## Digest
### Problem
1. `yarn audit` detects vulnerabilities, but cannot fix them.
Authors suggest using [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) for security patches. Well, it is very inconvenient in some situations, to say the least of it.
The discussion: [yarn/issues/7075](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/7075).
2. `yarn audit` does not support custom (in-house, internal) registries. Here are the [issue](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/7012) & [PR](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/6484) which have not yet received the green light.

### Solution
Fortunately, there are several workarounds:
1. Compose `npm audit fix` with lockfile converter (thanks to [Gianfranco P.](https://github.com/gianpaj), [stackoverflow/60878037](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60878037)).
   `yarn-audit-fix --flow=convert` just reproduces these steps with minimal changes. More details: [dev.to/yarn-audit-fix-workaround](https://dev.to/antongolub/yarn-audit-fix-workaround-i2a)
2. Fetch `yarn/npm audit --json` advisories and patch lockfile inners (kudos to [G. Kosev](https://github.com/spion), [code reference](https://github.com/hfour/yarn-audit-fix-ng/blob/main/src/index.ts)). `yarn-audit-fix --flow=patch`. Full description: [dev.to/yarn-audit-fix-for-yarn-2-berry](https://dev.to/antongolub/the-missing-yarn-audit-fix-for-yarn-2-berry-1p8)

### Key features
* Works with Yarn 1 Classic & Yarn v2+ lockfiles (‚ö†Ô∏è experimental)
* A couple of strategies to fix security issues
* macOS / Linux / Windows support
* CLI / JS API
* TS and flow typings

### ENV
All mentioned above CLI options can be replaced with the corresponding env variables with leading **YAF** prefix. For example:
* `YAF_FORCE` equals `--force`
* `YAF_ONLY=prod` ‚Äî `--only=prod`

### JS API
**yarn-audit-fix** is a naive and optimistic workaround, so it exposes all of its inners to give anybody a chance to tweak up and find a better steps combination.
Typedoc: [https://antongolub.github.io/yarn-audit-fix/modules/](https://antongolub.github.io/yarn-audit-fix/modules/)

```ts
import { run, runSync } from 'yarn-audit-fix'

// NOTE actually it's promisified `run.sync`
await run({
   flow: 'patch',
   verbose: true
})

// `runSync` is an alias for `run.sync`
await runSync({
  flow: 'patch',
  verbose: true
})
```

Build and run custom flows.
```ts
import {
   clear,
   exit,
   patchLockfile,
   yarnInstall
} from 'yarn-audit-fix'

export const flow: TFlow = {
  main: [
    [
      'Patching yarn.lock with audit data...',
      patchLockfile,
      (...args) => {console.log('Smth interesting:', ...args)},
      yarnInstall,
    ],
    ['Done'],
  ],
  fallback: [['Failure!', exit]],
}

await run({}, flow)
```

## Migration notes
### ^10.0.0
v10 bumps the pkg deps and requires NodeJS v14.

### ^9.0.0
v9 brings experimental Yarn 2+ lockfiles support, so the previous behaviour (when `yaf` parsing failure may be used to detect them) has been changed.

### ^8.0.0
From v8 the library does not contain **npm** dependency, so the system default is used instead. If necessary you can:
* Install the required npm version and provide a custom path via [CLI](#cli) / [ENV](#env) / [JS API](#js-api)
* Use a pinch of **npx** magic: `npm_config_yes=true YAF_NPM_PATH=local npx -p yarn-audit-fix -p npm@8 -c yarn-audit-fix`

### ^7.0.0
Following the deps, converted to ESM. So legacy `require` API has been dropped since v7.0.0. Use the shiny new `import` instead or try your luck with [esm-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qiwi/esm). CLI works as before.
```js
// const {run} = require('yarn-audit-fix') turns into
import {run} from 'yarn-audit-fix'
```

### ^6.0.0
Default fix strategy [has been changed](https://github.com/antongolub/yarn-audit-fix/releases/tag/v6.0.0) to direct lockfile patching with `yarn audit --json` data. To use the previous _legacy_ flow, pass `--flow=convert` option to CLI.

### ^4.0.0
`--npm-v7` flag is redundant. From v4.0.0 package's own version of **npm** is used by default. But you're still able to invoke system default with `--npm-path=system` or define any custom `--npm-path=/another/npm/bin`.

## Troubleshooting
### DoS vulnerability for colors 1.4.x
If you have installed yaf between 7...11 of Jan 2022 and ran it with `--flow=convert` option, you might see an endless garbage loop in stdout.
The problem was caused by the transitive dep: `yarn-audit-fix ‚Üí synp ‚Üí colors@^1.4.0`. Reasons and details: [issues/218](https://github.com/antongolub/yarn-audit-fix/issues/218), [snykvuln/2331906](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-COLORS-2331906).  
How to fix? There are 3 ways:
* Update yarn-audit-fix to `>=9.0.5`
* Pin `colors` version in your lockfile to `1.4.0`
* Reinstall yarn-audit-fix. It looks like npm has already removed the vulnerable versions of `colors` from the registry, 2022-01-11.

### yarn-audit-fix version x.x.x is out of date
```
npm_config_yes=true npx yarn-audit-fix --audit-level=moderate
Runtime digest
yarn-audit-fix version 4.3.6 is out of date. Install the latest 6.0.0 for better results
```
**npx** caches previously loaded packages, so you need one of:
1. Define version to load: `npm yarn-audit-fix@6.0.0`
2. Reset npx cache. For Mac/Linux: `rm -rf ~/.npm/_npx`

### yarn-audit-fix command not found
After installation, the package may not be found. This is probably an issue with $PATH finding `node_modules/.bin` contents or smth like that ([npm/issues/957](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/957)).
A bit annoying, but it's easy to handle in several ways.
* You're able to run the cmd through **yarn**: `yarn yarn-audit-fix`.
* Simply invoke `node_modules/.bin/yarn-audit-fix` script.

### enoent: no such file or directory
In some cases **npm audit fix** makes `node_modules` to become inconsistent. This is expected. **yarn** and **npm** organize the directory space slightly differently.
```

```
Let's try this workaround:
1. Restore the original `node_modules` state. `yarn --force` or `rm-rf node_modules && yarn`.
2. Apply `npx yarn-audit-fix --package-lock-only`. The last param should instruct **npm** not to modify `node_modules` contents.

### --force did not force the update
The problem only concerns repositories with `workspaces` (monorepos). 
`npm audit fix --force` throws 1 status code and suggests running `npm audit fix --force`. This quite ironic behaviour is exactly what **npm** (arborist) [does now](https://github.com/npm/arborist/blob/5b550501f50d6489d7e5f7598a97a5cf4cc5cc8a/lib/arborist/build-ideal-tree.js#L373).

```
So you need, as the message says, to manually change the dependency versions. **npm@7** ~~is still in beta~~, perhaps this logic will be changed later.
In some cases **npm@6** works better, so if you have such a version installed on your system, you may try:
```shell
npx yarn-audit-fix --npm-path=system --flow=convert
```
You may also try to cast _the optimistic flags combo_
```shell
npx yarn-audit-fix --package-lock-only=false --force --legacy-peer-deps --flow=convert
```
Unfortunately, even this invocation may return something like:
```shell

**No fix available** just means that no fix available. If you still doubt the correctness of the output, you can check it by hand.
```shell
npm i --package-lock-only
npm audit fix --package-lock-only --force
```

Same response for alternative patching flow:
```shell
npm_config_yes=true npx yarn-audit-fix --audit-level=moderate --flow=patch
```
```shell
Patching yarn.lock with audit data...
invoke yarn audit --json --level moderate
Can't find patched version that satisfies postcss@^7.0.0 in >=8.2.10

Not everything can be repaired, alack.

### Cannot install package despite being on correct node version
yarn-audit-fix is compatible with any NodeJS version which supports ESM, but the nested packages can define their own engine requirements.
```shell
pkg-dir@7.0.0: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. Expected version ">=14.16". Got "14.15.1"
```

The _recommended_ way is to update the runtime version. As a temporary workaround, you can simply pass `--ignore-engines` flag.
```shell
yarn add yarn-audit-fix -D --ignore-engines
```
